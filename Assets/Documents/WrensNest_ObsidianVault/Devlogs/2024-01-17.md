Continuing from a while ago since I last wrote about my development stuff here. Since then, I had that demo day, then Christmas Break. Between those two time periods, I mostly worked on other stuff and eventually got a nice NEW computer! The Wren's Nest hasn't ever looked (and played) so well.

In any case, it's my last semester here at school. I'm doing this internship for a last session before I can continue it on my own after graduation. That said, I have some things I wanted to change and plans and all that.

Firstly, I wanted to make SelectableObjects easier to find and see. To that end, I've made little UI "pins" or little UI billboarded objects that point towards visible SelectableObjects in the view. I've also found a nice, new, Prefab-oriented way to make SelectableObjects so I don't have things so disorganized and hard to find in my project.

I've just implemented that and BOY that'll make finding and editing my SelectableObjects much easier!

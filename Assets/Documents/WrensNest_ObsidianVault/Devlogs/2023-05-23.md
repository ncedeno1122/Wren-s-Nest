Continuing from [[2023-05-22]].

So today I've made a repo for this project because that's probably wise.

As well, my main goal this week is to try and give the Wren's Nest a "cabin-y" feel like we'd described. Only problem is, I'm not a great 3D modeller... But, I'll do my best here!

I also found a bug while playtesting! Every time I hit the right click button, the Camera SNAPS downwards. If I had to guess, it's got something to do with the selection state anda ll that.

I tried to use Probuilder in Unity, but it was really only good for prototyping things. If I want them to look a little better and be more accurately editable, I'll likely need to open up Blender or Maya...

I spent a TON of my day 3D modelling a basic thing of the Wren's Nest that I could use, but I haven't yet learned to make sense of the UVs for the texture work I'd need to do. Overall though, I got the structure of the house and rooves looking *okay*, but I can't seem to align the textures well enough yet.

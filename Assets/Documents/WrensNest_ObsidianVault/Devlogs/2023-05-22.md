Continuing from [[2023-05-21]].

So yesterday I got a pretty decent proof of concept of the selection logic and all that. There's still a few things to work out, but it's not been bad so far.

One thing I wanted to add, since this would be a hub-world-type-area is some UI to show the current time. And in like 4 minutes, it's done, how neat! I appreciate how intuitive the DateTime structure is in this very limited context I'm using it in. Dates and time stink to work with otherwise, of that I'm aware.

As well, I have some interesting little bugs in which the camera JOLTS downwards for whatever reason. I'm not sure why this is exactly, but I think it has something to do with the Lerping process with the rotation and the way the Quaternion math works... But I don't know, I was able to fix it by setting the final position and rotation to the target, which looks fairly seamless. Noice!

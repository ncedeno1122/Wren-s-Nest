Continuing from [[2023-05-24]].

In my previous notes this week, I've failed to articulate some of the other things I've done. When I work in Unity, waiting for scripts to reload gives me time to pen my notes here, but in other programs I don't communicate my workflow nearly as well.
Particularly, that I was up to some music and 3D modelling this week, which has been quite some fun. However, I didn't figure out my problem before I left to make some music yesterday. I'll try and do this today.

Y'know, this CameraSelectionState is really dragging me down. I'm thinking about how necessary it is, and I'm afraid it really... might not be necessary. As such, I'll try and eradicate it.
Aaaand with this, the error is CURRENTLY solved! Pretty neat!

Continuing from [[2023-05-24]].

In my previous notes this week, I've failed to articulate some of the other things I've done. When I work in Unity, waiting for scripts to reload gives me time to pen my notes here, but in other programs I don't communicate my workflow nearly as well.
Particularly, that I was up to some music and 3D modelling this week, which has been quite some fun. However, I didn't figure out my problem before I left to make some music yesterday. I'll try and do this today.

Y'know, this CameraSelectionState is really dragging me down. I'm thinking about how necessary it is, and I'm afraid it really... might not be necessary. As such, I'll try and eradicate it.
Aaaand with this, the error is CURRENTLY solved! Pretty neat!

And I should mention that with my remaining time today I'm feeling *EXTREMELY* musical. With the ability to set the current time properly as I'm doing, I keep thinking of the seasons, and day and night themes and all that... I'll indulge in this for the moment with the time I have left today.

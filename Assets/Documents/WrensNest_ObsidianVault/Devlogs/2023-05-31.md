Continuing from [[2023-05-26]]. Gah, it's been quite a busy week so far. I had some really intensive outside work to do, which stunk. It stunk particularly because I'm lacking a sufficient roadmap to proceed on my ideas, really. This mostly comes from that I feel somewhat insecure with my ownership over and scope of these projects combined. But I know I should be more confident. For now, they're in my hands and I need to make the decisions to fill this all in with good content!

Yesterday or so, I made some 9-sliced UI backgrounds. I was somewhat proud of this because of how simple and effective it was to do this. This week so far, I was practicing and drafting some more music for the Wren's Nest, which was really fun.

I think tonight, I want to try and 3D model a table or some chairs for the Wren's Nest and all that. The only thing is that I know so little about UVs and texturing, I suck at that right now! But I want to get better. It's a nice night and I don't have to get up early tomorrow, so maybe I'll watch a little video on it and see how to do some proper texturing.

I want to try and attempt another model of the Wren's Nest that's actually connected a lot better. Maybe even all one mesh with some connected parts and all that. Just something I can slice to properly size the UVs and all that. But man, I really stink at this (on my first attempt). I'll have to try  again tomorrow and see how I do then.
